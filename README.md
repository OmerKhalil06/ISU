## __Goal for June__
---
The Goal of this assignment is for students to complete their project, reflect, and video by the end of the semester. I would like to accomplish a few things before june. First I want to create a fully function fighting-game that is similar to some past favourites, but is innovative in a variety of ways (online multiplayer, special abilities, combos, and powerups). to do this I will need to create my own program that will incorperate objects and other tools learned in the semester, while also searching out and learning new tools such as pygame, hitboxes, and even game design. I will also complete my video and reflection before june that will sumerize teh adventure of creating this game.
