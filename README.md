---
## __Purpose of This Project__
---
The purpose of this project is for students to code and create somthing by the end of the semester. Students must research and learn new methods modules, and libraries to create their project. Students will have confrences with the evalutator as well as track their project. By the end of the semester, students must submit their program, a reflection paper, and a video reflecting on their program and experince. 

## __Goal for June__
---
The Goal of this assignment is for students to complete their project, reflect, and video by the end of the semester. I would like to accomplish a few things before june. First I want to create a fully function fighting-game that is similar to some past favourites, but is innovative in a variety of ways (online multiplayer, special abilities, combos, and powerups). to do this I will need to create my own program that will incorperate objects and other tools learned in the semester, while also searching out and learning new tools such as pygame, hitboxes, and even game design. I will also complete my video and reflection before june that will sumerize teh adventure of creating this game. 
## __Technology used__
---
To complete this assignment I plan on using a variety of tools. First, I plan on coding the game in python using what I have learned in the course. I also will need to learn pygame to allow my game to function. I will learn basic game design to make my game look clean and polished. Finally I plan on learning all types of mechanics that are associeted with games such as hitboxes, animations, and more. ]
